        <p>
            I am an aspiring front end web-developer,
            I am currently trying to acquire as much
            knowledge as possible to secure my first job
            in the tech industry! I come from a non-traditional
            background with nothing related to tech; except, my
            ability to learn! I was formerly a video editor for
            four years; although, I did this just for fun I learned
            how to edit videos and footage from scratch, without
            really much help. I was able to garner an audience
            on social media platforms like YouTube and Instagram
            within my time editing, but I soon decided to move on
            to coding due to a more promising career. I felt as
            if the transition was seamless, I was learning
            something for the first time and it was completely new and foreign to me. The challenge excited me. I am
            currently nine-teen years old, I am self studying and doing everything I can possible to lock-in my future
            in tech. Whether that be going to meetups, listening to tech podcasts non-stop, networking, connecting, or
            even documenting my journey along the way. All I need is that one chance from a daring company to be
            successful due to my hustle, motivation, grit, and growth mindset. Will you be that lucky company?
